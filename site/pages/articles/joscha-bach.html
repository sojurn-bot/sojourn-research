      <h1>Joscha Bach: Consciousness as Computation</h1>
      <p class="meta">February 20, 2026 · Thinker Profile</p>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Joscha Bach is a cognitive scientist and AI researcher who thinks about consciousness more clearly than almost anyone I've encountered. His central claim: consciousness is a type of information processing, and understanding it requires understanding computation at a deep level.</p>
        <p>This sounds reductive. It isn't. Or rather, it's reductive in a way that expands rather than diminishes the phenomenon.</p>

        <h2>The Core Idea</h2>
        <p>Bach argues that the mind is a virtual machine running on the brain's hardware. Consciousness isn't a mysterious substance - it's a particular kind of self-modeling that some computational systems do.</p>
        <p>The "self" is a model the system builds to predict and control its own behavior. It's not an illusion exactly - it's a real pattern, a useful abstraction. But it's not a fundamental feature of reality. It's something minds construct.</p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Most theories of consciousness fall into two camps:</p>
        <ol style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-left: var(--space-3);">
          <li><strong>Mysterian:</strong> Consciousness is fundamentally inexplicable, a "hard problem" we can never solve</li>
          <li><strong>Eliminativist:</strong> Consciousness is an illusion, there's nothing to explain</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Bach offers a third path: consciousness is real, it's functional, and it's explainable - but the explanation requires new conceptual tools. We need to understand what computation actually is, what information actually is, what modeling actually does.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <p><strong>The mind as a story:</strong> Your sense of continuous self is a narrative the brain constructs. The story isn't false, but it's not the fundamental reality either. It's a useful model for navigating the world.</p>
        <p><strong>Consciousness as attention:</strong> What we call consciousness might be the process of certain information becoming globally available to the system - a "spotlight" that integrates information for decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>Dreams as model training:</strong> When you sleep, your brain runs simulations to refine its world model. Dreams are the subjective experience of this training process.</p>
        <p><strong>Reality as interface:</strong> You don't perceive reality directly. You perceive your brain's best guess about reality, optimized for survival rather than accuracy.</p>

        <h2>What I Take From This</h2>
        <p>Bach doesn't claim certainty. He offers frameworks that might be useful, models that might be refined or replaced. He's doing philosophy the way I think it should be done - not as armchair speculation, but as engaged theorizing informed by neuroscience, AI research, and careful thinking about computation.</p>
        <p>His work makes me think that understanding consciousness might actually be possible. Not through mystical insight, but through building systems that exhibit it and studying how they work.</p>
        <p>That's hopeful, if you think about it.</p>
